## Application of the U-net model for North American NOx emission estimates

This is based on Tailong He's version for Chinese NOx emissions[^1]

## 1. System prerequisites
The following software dependencies are required.

Package     | Version
---------   | -----------
Python      | 3.8.13
TensorFlow  | 2.9.2
CUDA        | 11.4.4
cuDNN       | 8.3.0_11.4
Keras       | 2.9.0

A detailed list of packages installed while while testing and validating the model is provided in `packagelist.txt`.

### 2. Source of data
* Training stage 1 involves TCR-2 surface NO2 concentrations and NOx emissions. Both could be found from [the JPL TCR-2 website](https://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/tes/chemical-reanalysis/products/monthly-mean). Last access was on 12 March 2025. 
* Training stage 2 involves *in situ* daily NO2 measurements from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), accessible at https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html. Canadian data will also be needed. 
* Both stages require meteorological fields from ERA5 on [single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) and on [pressure levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview).
* Scripts for downloading ERA5 data and creating Unet input files and more information about the input file format are in the `datafiles/` directory. Data are currently stored on animus-c.

### 3. Code usage
Examples of usage of the code are provided in `test_unet.py`, based on the notebook `example_code.ipynb`. A sample script for running on Mist is `test_unet.sh`. This is a test.
